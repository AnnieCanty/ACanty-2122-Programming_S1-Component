Third Session

Continued Using Tutorials

Using unity documentation and looking over previous notes helped me overcome this.

Fourth Session

Continued Using Tutorials

Decided to create pause menu tutorial in order to support with future UI endevors and curret 3D projects. Followed tutorial with no isses and now need to understand how to further implement in different styles eg colours, images etc. Possibly spent more time than required setting up and following code
